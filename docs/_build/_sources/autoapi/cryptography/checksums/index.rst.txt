   cryptography.checksums.Hasher




.. py:class:: Hasher


   Allows checksum generation of binary data either from a file or message.

   .. py:method:: get_file_checksum(filename, block = 2**20)

      |coro|

      Generates a calculated ``SHA512`` hash for a given file.

      :param filename: The name of the file to generate the checksum for.
      :type filename: :class:`str`
      :param block: Chunk size to read and hash the file in bytes. Default is ``2^20``.
      :type block: Optional[:class:`int`]

      :returns: The calculated ``SHA512`` hash of the file, or ``None`` if there was an error generating the checksum.
      :rtype: :class:`str`

      .. rubric:: Notes

      - This function generates a ``SHA512`` hash for a given file by reading the file in blocks and hashing each block.        The generated hash is a digest checksum (a unique fixed-sized representation of the file content) and        the file is treated as a binary file (read in ``rb`` mode) for proper handling of all types of files.

      - The reason ``SHA512`` was chosen is purely for the lack of collisions at runtime when performing dynamic checks.
